## Why PancakeView?

In a lot of Xamarin.Forms UI work I do I have the need for a layout/view that I can use that supports gradients, borders, rounded corners and shadows. Since none of the existing Xamarin.Forms controls fit the bill I decided to roll my own. And why is it called a ```PancakeView``` you ask? Well, pancakes are also round, have shadows and have a glorious gradient color. What better fit can you think of?
